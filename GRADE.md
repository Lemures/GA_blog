Martin,

I don't see much here at all. Did you push the correct project? I only see a Home controller and the Devise install.

Not much to comment on here, but I will say that placing the authentication filter on the Home controller may not be a good idea. You will effectively block out all users from seeing anything when they visit your app unless they log in.
